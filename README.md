# E-Commerce Application - MERN Stack Project (Milestone 2)

### Overview

In this project the second milestone towards an E-Commerce application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) is presented. In this milestone, I will focus on setting up both the frontend and backend directories, configuring Tailwind CSS for modern styling, and building the login page for user authentication. The goal is to set up the core structure for your E-Commerce platform, with an emphasis on clean, organized code and responsive design.

### Key features of Milestone 2

In this milestone, I will accomplish the following tasks:

- Organize Project Structure: Learn project organization with both frontend and backend directories.
- React Frontend Setup: Initialize a React application for building the user interface.
- Node.js Backend Setup: Set up a simple Node.js server to prepare for API integration in future milestones.
- Tailwind CSS Configuration: Integrate and set up Tailwind CSS for utility- first, responsive design.
- Login Page Development: Create the user interface for logging in users, focusing on both functionality and styling.


### Learning Objectives

At the end of this phase, I will be able to:.

- Set up and configure a React application for building the user interface of your E-Commerce platform.
- Set up a Node.js backend server with Express to capture API requests.
- Incorporate Tailwind CSS for component styling and responsive design.
- Implement a Login form which enables users to log in with sure form validation and contemporary look.

# E-Commerce Application - MERN Stack Project (Milestone 3)

### Overview

This is the third phase/milestone of the E-Commerce MERN Stack Project, in which I will upgrade the backend structure of your e-commerce system. In this milestone, I further focus on the backend development by effectively structuring your code, using MongoDB for data storage and introducing some basic error handling. This provides the base from which a solid backend can support the frontend, as well as any future additions to the application.

### Key Features of Milestone 3

- Backend Folder Structure: Group the back end code into routes, controllers, models, and middleware for easier maintenance.
- Server Setup: Configure a Node.js server using Express to receive and respond to API requests.
- Database Connection: Integrate MongoDB to hold and manage data, ensuring that the server is successfully able to establish and maintain a connection to the database.
- Error Handling: Implement basic mechanisms for error handling to maintain seamless communication between client and server.


### Learning Objectives

By the end of this milestone, I will:
- Organize a well-structured backend folder structure to facilitate the maintainability and scalability of your application.
- Configure and start a Node.js server using Express.
- Integrate my application with MongoDB for data storage and retrieval.
- Perform simple error handling to facilitate debugging and a better user experience.

# E-Commerce Application - MERN Stack Project (Milestone 4)

### Overview

Welcome to Milestone 4 of the E-Commerce MERN Stack Project! The main contribution of this milestone is to improve the backend by designing the User Model to reason about user information, to design the User Controller to interact with the user information, and to configure Multer to upload user files (e.g., user profile pictures) to the backend.

### Key Features of Milestone 4

- User Model: Design a schema to represent user data in the MongoDB database.
- User Controller: Implement the algorithm for the user-related work such as registration, authentication, and retrieval of the user information.
- File Uploads with Multer: Implement file upload that stores images (e.g., user profile pictures) on the server.
- Update README: Document your progress and update your project details.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this milestone, I will:
- Learn about the role of Models as well as how to build a User Model in MongoDB to organise user data.
- Find out how to build a User Controller so that it can perform user-related actions.
- Support Multer for file uploads, so your application is able to upload images to it.
- Amend the README.md file to cover the changes made in this milestone.

# E-Commerce Application - MERN Stack Project (Milestone 5)

### Overview

Welcome to Milestone 5, the E-Commerce MERN Stack Project! In this milestone, I will concentrate on frontend development and build a Sign-Up Page in which users can sign up for a new account. I will also include form validation to keep information provided by users accurate and secure before it is sent to the backend.

### Key Features of Milestone 5

- Sign-Up Page: Build the user interface for registering users with fields like name, email, and password.
- Form Validation: Implement validation to guarantee the correctness of user inputs (e.g., email format, password strength).
- Update README: Describe your development and the new features incorporated into the project.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this milestone, I will:
- Design a Registration Form that lets the users input their registration information.
- Define form validation so that the fields, such as the email and the password, comply with the right format.
- Update the README.md file for an overview of the changes implemented in this milestone.

# E-Commerce Application - MERN Stack Project (Milestone 6)

### Overview

Welcome to Milestone 6, E-Commerce MERN Stack Project. In this milestone, I am going to focus on the backend. I will design an endpoint to process user sign-up requests securely, store user data securely, and encrypt the password prior to storing the data in the database.

### Key Features of Milestone 6

- Password Encryption: Applies the  library to hash and encrypt the user's password before saving it.
- Storing User Data: Save all user details (name, email, etc.) And keep the password unencrypted in the database) to protect the user's password against unauthorised access.
- Updated README: Record your work by including a new section reporting what has been achieved during this milestone.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this milestone, I will:
- Understand how to securely encrypt passwords using .
- Understand how to secure storage of user data in the database as well as implement best practices.
- Supplement the README.md with details of the work completed in Milestone 6.

Hereâ€™s the simplified README with just the Overview, Key Features, and Learning Outcomes:.

# E-Commerce Application - MERN Stack Project (Milestone 7)

### Overview

In Milestone 7, I again lay emphasis on the development of a secure backend login endpoint. The main goal is to verify the users' credentials by comparing the entered password of the user with the password of the database which is encrypted. Iâ€™ll also use a hashing algorithm like bcrypt to securely hash passwords, ensuring user data protection, privacy, and compliance with security standards.

### Key Features

- User Login Endpoint: This document outlines how to implement a RESTful authentication endpoint securing the user experience by verifying the credentials of the users (email/username  password).
- Password Hashing: Implement bcrypt to hash the user's password and compares the hash to the hashed password in the database.
- Error Handling: If the user is not found or passwords are not matched with correct error message.
- Secure Data Protection: Security is improved even in the event of a database leak by never storing passwords in clear text.

### Learning Outcomes ðŸŽ¯

By the end of this milestone, I will:
- Know how to verify user credentials during the login flow.
- Obtain an idea of how to securely hash passwords to verify authentication.
- One of the outcomes gets training in implementing password security storage with hashing algorithms such as bcrypt.
- Acknowledge the need for data protection and privacy in user authentication systems.
